\title{Remove Lowly Expressed Genes From Expression Data}
\usage{
rm_low_counts(
  expr,
  count_threshold = NULL,
  perc_threshold = NULL,
  transpose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{expr}{A matrix of gene expression with cells as rows and genes as
columns}

\item{count_threshold}{A threshold for the number of counts a gene must
have to be included. Only one threshold may be used at a time.}

\item{perc_threshold}{A threshold for what percentile the gene counts
should be cut off at. Only one threshold may be used at a time.}

\item{transpose}{A logical value indicating whether the expression
matrix should be transposed before any operations are carried out.}
}
\value{
A matrix of gene expressions with the low count genes, as
specified by the user, removed.
